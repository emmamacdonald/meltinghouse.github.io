Melting House is a chocolate shop and kitchen based in Yorkshire where we make small batches of handmade chocolate.

From truffles, bars, slabs and shard to Easter eggs, chocolate hampers, cakes and baked goods; everything is made by hand here by our small team of chocolatiers.

Youâ€™ll also find personalised chocolates and freshly handmade treats. Come along to our Mirfield shop to see chocolate making in action in the Melting House kitchen!
