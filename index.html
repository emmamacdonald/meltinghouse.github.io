Melting House is a chocolate shop and kitchen based in Yorkshire where we make small batches of handmade chocolate.

From truffles, bars, slabs and shard to Easter eggs, chocolate hampers, cakes and baked goods; all our chocolate is made by hand here by our small team of chocolatiers. Come along to our Mirfield shop to see chocolate making in action in the Melting House kitchen!


Youâ€™ll also find personalised chocolates and freshly handmade treats. Plus, we stock ranges from British chocolate producers such as Essy and Bella, Booja Booja and Choc on Choc. 

So, whether you need a gift for someone special or chocolate that's dairy or gluten free, we've got something for everyone.
